In a nutshell:

- Bootstrapping directly from the clouds. It will attempt to upgrade already installed tools to the latest available version.  

  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mawinkler/c1-playground/master/bin/playground | bash && exit
  ```

- No `git clone`.
- No `daemon.json` configuration.
- Run the menu by executing `playground` from anywhere on your system.
- Bootstrapping has never been easier!
